For test there is one short video with myself and fake facereader out for it

To generate datatset run python scripts:

_0extractPointsFroVideos.py
_0getClassesFromFacereader.py
_1corelate.py
_2normalize.py

If you want real dataset then put folders with videos to ../DATA
and FaceReader outputs to ../DATA_OUT_FACEREADER
